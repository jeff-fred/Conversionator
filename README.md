Application made solely with Python using the Tkinter GUI module. 

I made this application to help me with my math homework when I don't have internet or a calculator on hand.

The basics of how the program works are the following:
- 1.) The frames are all stacked on to each other on the same window. The window does nothing, its just a container.
- 2.) All the frames are contained in a dict that is later used to call the frame. 
- 3.) Each class is very similar, they just use different values. 
- 4.) The only classes that are different are the MainMenu class and the main Conversionator class, which is the main window.
- 5.) The conversions are called using drop down menus that are related to dictionary of conversions stated in the beginnind of the class.
- 6.) We calculate the result by taking the input value, multiplying that by the conversion, rounding the number and displaying that out using a str.
 
Application Example:
